# Formin Kinetic Model

Kinetic model of FH1 actin polymerization based on the paper: Bryant, Clemens, Allard, "Computational simulation of formin‐mediated actin polymerization predicts homologue‐dependent mechanosensitivity"
Cytoskeleton 2017.

Requires as input look-up tables generated by the Formin Polymer Model (see separate repository).


## Quick start

* Make sure python3 and Matlab are installed.
* In /main/wholepackage.m, change `path` to the folder lookup tables
